Then tap one more time to change again the zoom level.\n- The Notifications tab now displays a badge when you have notifications. By default, all supported types of notifications are taken into account, except journal notifications. You can change this behavior in the Settings tab.\n- Scrolling through a user's gallery, scraps or favorites now automatically loads the next page when needed. This effectively makes scrolling infinite as long as more content is available.\n- User's gallery, scraps and favorites now have a search field at the top. Combined with infinite loading, this effectively allows searching through a full gallery, scraps or favorites of any user. Search is case insensitive and done on the submissions title and author.\n\nüì¶ MISCELLANEOUS\n- Submissions and journals where comments have been disabled is now reflected in the app: the comment icon has a different color and tapping it will inform that posting a comment is not possible.",
